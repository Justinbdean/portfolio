            This project was a part of an independent study course during the spring quarter of 2024. The professor sponsoring my independennt study had another course where students were producing a short film. Their film involved swarms of bug-like robots that were invading Chicago. My professor and I decided a good project would be to learn how to use python in Maya. Since the artists needed the ability to create swarms, I wrote a script that utilized the Maya library and instanced their objects. I added additional features as we went on that allowed for determined shapes or for random placements in a specified area. The last piece of this project was figuring out a region of the bug so that another instanced bug wasn't created in the same area. I focused on working with the artists in the class to meet their needs and build the tool to be as user friendly as possible. This was my first time utilizing my programming skills in a creative application and was a great experience. The script can be found on my Github.
