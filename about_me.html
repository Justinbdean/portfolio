            <p>
                Hey! My name is Justin Blackburn. I am a senior at DePaul University studying Information Technology with a concentration in New Media Engineering as well as a minor in Visual Effects.         
            </p>
            <p>
                While at DePaul, I have taken courses ranging from purely technical topics to artist-focused workshops. As a result, I have been fortunate to work with other students from all types of degrees. I have worked on technical projects with computer science students to film projects with animation students. My studies have allowed me to blend technical and artistic subjects to get the best from both worlds. Lately, I have been delving into the world of Technical Direction and Pipeline Development for animation or VFX productions. I want to continue my personal skill development while collaborating with others to create technically driven art. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Technical skills I have primarily spent time using include Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and VEX. I have utilized these skills in object-oriented programming, application development, web development, computer networking, and database management. As for creative software, I mainly work with Houdini, Maya, and Unreal Engine. I have utilized my diverse technical and artistic knowledge through the use of VEX within Houdini and Python within Maya. One highlight of my intersection of skills was developing a custom Python tool in Maya for artists. 
            </p>
