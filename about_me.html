                Hey! My name is Justin Blackburn. I am a senior at DePaul University currently studying Information Technology with a concentration in New Media Engineering. I also have minors in Visual Effects and Virtual Production Environment Design.             
            </p>
            <p>
                Studying IT: New Media Engineering at DePaul has be a really fun and unique experience. The degree is set up to create a curriclum that blends creative and technical classes. I've taken classes that range from film production, 3D modeling, virtual cinematography, database managment, computer networking, and various programming courses. I am passionate about finding a space where technology and the arts meet and can challenge each other. 
            </p>         
            <p>
                I am looking to become a technical director, or adjacent posistion, at either an animation or visual effects company.
            </P>
            <p>
