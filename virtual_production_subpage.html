            Over the summer, I was able to work on a virtual production short film. I lead a small team where we built a virtual environment and aided in on set technical support for the virtual volume. I specically worked on assembling the scene within Unreal Engine from assets built by my team members as well as from Quixel Bridge. I had only just touched Unreal for the first time in January of 2024 so this was a big confidence boost in what I was capable in doing. We were able to film the short film at SMASH Studio in Chicago, Illinois which was a fantastic experience. While I might not be pursuing virtual production for a career, I want to continue making projects with this emerging technology.
